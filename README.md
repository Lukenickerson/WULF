# WULF - Web-based Ultima-Like Framework

WULF is a project that intends to create a framework based on open web technology that would allow easy creation of Ultima-like browser games.

## Philosophy

* Open, interactive, simulated world
  - Go anywhere
  - Time always passes
* Persistant, living characters
  - PCs become NPCs when their player is offline
  - Bot-friendly
  - Aging and mortality
* Everything happens in the fiction/simulation
  - Nothing should be indestructible or immortal, except by in-game mechanics
  - World-building is done by entities (gods, wizards)
* Framework needs to be easy to enhance
  - Modular components
  - Keep an eye towards future additions; don't prevent modification
  - JavaScript is a language that many developers know and that can be learned online
  - Open source
* Online-capable
  - Server-Client architecture
* Top-down 2D is sufficient
  - Simple graphics

## Wishlist (TBD)

* Map builder
* Load map by height map and terrain grid
* _...TBD... in progress..._
