# WULF - Web-based Ultima-Like Framework

WULF is a project that intends to create a framework based on open web technology that would allow easy creation of Ultima-like browser games.

## Philosophy

* Open and interactive world
* Modular components
* Keep an eye towards future additions; don't prevent modification
* Online-capable (Server-Client architecture)
* Persistant characters - PCs become NPCs when their player is offline
* Nothing is indestructible or immortal, except by in-game mechanics
* Top-down 2D is sufficient
* Bot-friendly

## Wishlist (TBD)

* Map builder
* Load map by height map and terrain grid
* _...TBD... in progress..._
